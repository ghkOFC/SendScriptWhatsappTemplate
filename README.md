⚠️ Important notice, in a recent update of Google Chrome, any script is being prevented from being pasted into the Console.
To get around this problem, the developer console waits for a textual confirmation by writing in the console: "allow pasting"
After that, it will be allowed to paste and continue executing the script
Paste the code into the console and press Enter

Done
